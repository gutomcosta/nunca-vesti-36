			<h3>Templates of the theme</h3>
			<p>The theme has several templates that you may use for your needs. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Various templates which can be used both for home and blog pages</li>
                <li>About Page (file templ-about.php)</li>
                <li>Contact Page (file templ-contact.php)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Make a home page like in our demo is pretty simple. First, create a static page and choose one of templates for home page for this page. Than
            choose 'a static page' option for Front Page displays settings and choose your created static page:</p>
            <img src="images/francoise-1.png" width="615" height="213" alt="">
            <p>You are done!</p>
            <p>And some words about recommended sizes of the images. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>equal or larger then 1170x570 for slide images</li>
                <li>Template 'Home Page One': equal or larger then 1170×570, 570x570 and 570x270</li>
                <li>Template 'Home Page Grid': equal or larger then 370×250</li>
                <li>Template 'Home Page List': equal or larger then 420x256</li>
                <li>Template 'Home Page Masonry': equal or larger then 370 by width</li>
                <li>equal or larger then 840x512 for posts on archive pages</li>
                <li>equal or larger then 840x560 for pages</li>
                <li>recommended logo size is 283×43 or something near this; and a slightly smaller logo for mobile versions, 174×26 for instance</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Because you can use any posts as slides in the slider, it is a good idea to keep featured images not smaller then 1170×570!</strong></p>
		</section>

		<section id="homepage" class="two">

			<h3>Home page templates</h3>
			<p>The theme has several templates for home page and/or blog page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Home Page One</li>
                <li>Home Page Grid</li>
                <li>Home Page List</li>
                <li>Home Page Masonry</li>
                <li>Home Page Slider</li>
                <li>Home Page Slider with no sidebar</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Template 'Home Page One' has a unique grid with 4 promo posts. Shown images are featured thumbnails for posts and three different image sizes
            are used here - 1170×570, 570x570 and 570x270. So it is a good idea to keep featured images not smaller then 1170×570. You can choose these four posts
            on theme options page. <a href="#options">Read more about how to manage them</a></p>

            <p>Templates 'Home Page List', 'Home Page Slider' and 'Home Page Slider with no sidebar' have sliders at the top of the page. You can choose posts
            for these sliders in the metabox on edit page screen. If you don't choose any posts, placeholder image with title 'No slides found' will be shown
            at the place where should be the slider.</p>

            <p><strong>If you have chosen less then 4 posts for home page grid manually on the theme options page - you won't see any of the chosen there but
            recent posts instead. It is required to choose 4 posts to view them all.</strong></p>

            <p>Additionally, for 'Home Page Slider with no sidebar', 'Home Page Slider', 'Home Page List', 'Home Page Grid' and 'Home Page Masonry' templates
            you are able to add custom content - image, title, URI and colour of the title, hover colour of the title and bg colour of overlay. Choose one of these
            templates for a page and you will see a meta box below the content editor. <strong>You have to
            choose/upload image, add title and URI, otherwise custom content won't be displayed! Also custom content will be shown ONLY if no posts have been selected on
            "Posts content" tab for 'Home Page Slider with no sidebar', 'Home Page Slider' and 'Home Page List'!</strong></p>

        <section id="plugins" class="two">

            <h3>Required and recommended plugins</h3>

            <p>There is some required and some recommended plugins. <strong>All the required plugins are bundled with the theme or can be downloaded from
             WordPress.org for free</strong> and only required plugins
            affect the basic functionality of the theme. Recommended plugins just add some additional functionality, they are not neccessary and some of them are not
            bundled with the theme. You can buy them or download for free (it depends on the particular plugin). 'Recommended' means that we tested how they
            work with the theme just to be sure that everything will be ok and we think that they can be useful in some particular situations.</p>

            <p>Some of the required plugins are paid and bundled with the theme, like 'Uni User Avatar', so you can use them with ease.</p>

            <p>Some of the recommended plugins are also paid and not bundled.</p>

            <h3>Dummy content</h3>

            <p>You can find export file with demo content in the folder 'Dummy content' within item's archive. First of all you have to activate Francoise theme,
            then activate plugins 'AccessPress Social Counter', 'WP Instagram Widget' and 'Uni User Avatar'. <strong>Otherwise, not
            all the information (especially custom post types and custom taxonomies) will be imported!</strong>. Than go to 'Tools' -> 'Import' admin menu and choose
            'WordPress' from the list. You will be asked to install 'WordPress Importer' plugin. Install it and activate. Now choose a file from your computer and click
            'Upload file and import'. Follow the instructions.</p>

            <p>Now you have to do a couple of things. First, assign menus (primary and footer menus) and choose 'Front page' page as front page of your website
            under Settings -> Reading admin menu.</p>

            <p>You are done!</p>

            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Q: How to change the favicon?</strong> <br>A: The theme uses 5 files with favicons for different resolutions/devices. They are: favicon.ico,
                favicon-16×16.png, favicon-32×32.png, apple-touch-icon-144×144.png, apple-touch-icon-152×152.png So, just change them, but keep the same file names.
                Use a child theme and change these files in the child theme, so you won't loose your customization after the next theme update.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: What is the proper way to customize your theme?</strong> <br>A: First, you should create a child theme. A sample of such child theme
                already is in item's archive. You can use it for your needs. Second, make all changes ONLY through your child theme. It is not a good idea to make
                changes in original theme's files because you won't be able to upgrade it. An additional information about managing a child theme
                <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">can be found here</a>.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: How to translate the theme on my language?</strong> <br>A: The theme translation files are located in 'languages' folder. Make a copy
                of en_GB.po, rename it to your lang tags, make a translation and save in to 'languages' folder. Also, you have to generate .mo file with the same name
                as your .po file. Save this file in to 'languages' folder too. You are done!</li>

                <li><strong>Q: What is the proper way to upgrade the theme?</strong> <br>A: You have to completely replace all the old files. It is event better to
                just delete an entire folder of your current Francoise parent theme, then upload the new folder with the theme. Also, we might make a decision to add
                some functions to 'functions.php' file of the precreated child theme, so it is always a good idea to look what is new added in that file and compare
                what you have in your current child theme. Of course, if you are using a child theme.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Why Mailchimp subscribe form still doesn't work?</strong> <br>A: The reason might be that curl extension is not enabled on your
                hosting/server. I added info section on the theme options page and you can check this information there. This is how it should look like:</li>

                <img src="images/francoise-8.png" width="966" height="274" alt="">

                <li><strong>Q: How to create/add my own colour scheme?</strong> <br>A: There is no such option on the theme options page. However I have added a new
                file <i>scheme-custom.css</i> into a child theme folder. This file is empty. But you can copy styles from any files which contain colour scheme styles
                (for instance "scheme-blue.css") into this new file scheme-custom.css and change particular properties and these new styles will be appplied to your
                child theme.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Is this theme retina ready?</strong> <br>A: In general, yes! This theme uses icons of fontawesome font and they look nice on screens
                with any resolutions and/or pixels density. If it comes about thumbnails then you can use this plugin
                <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-retina-2x/</a>. Activate it, choose best suitable option for you,
                regenerate thumbnails (needed only at the first time!) and you are done! And remember to use only big and high quality images on your website!</li>

                <li><strong>Q: Can I auto update this theme from WP admin?</strong> <br>A: Yes, you can. All you need to do is to install special plugin
                "Envato WordPress Toolkit". Here is <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/envato-wordpress-toolkit-guide/">a detailed instruction</a> how to achieve
                that.</li>

                <li><strong>Q: It seems that fonts are changed after upgrade to version 1.1.0 of the theme. How to fix that?</strong> <br>A: Yes, this might happen.
                All you need to do is visit once theme's options page ( /wp-admin/themes.php?page=ot-theme-options ). Just visit, that's all. It fixes fonts
                somehow)</li>
